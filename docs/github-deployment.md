## Quick Setup (10 minutes)

### 1. Create Service Principal (One-time)

```bash
# Login to Azure
az login

# Create service principal for CI/CD
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --name "ZavaGiftExchange-github-cicd" \
  --role contributor \
  --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}
```

**Output looks like:**
```json
{
  "appId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "displayName": "ZavaGiftExchange-github-cicd",
  "password": "xxxxxxx~xxxxx_xxx",
  "tenant": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "subscriptionId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repo, go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**:

**Secret 1: AZURE_CREDENTIALS** (Already created above)
- Value: Paste the entire JSON output from the service principal creation

**Secret 2: CLEANUP_SECRET** (New)
- This authenticates the scheduled cleanup cron job to call the cleanup HTTP endpoint
- Generate a strong random secret:
  ```bash
  # macOS/Linux
  openssl rand -base64 32
  
  # Windows PowerShell
  [Convert]::ToBase64String((1..32 | ForEach-Object { Get-Random -Maximum 256 }) -as [byte[]])
  ```
- Save the same value for both GitHub secret and Azure app settings (see step 3 below)

**That's it!** Two secrets, no variables needed.

### 3. Deploy to Auto-Configure Secrets in Azure

Once both `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and `CLEANUP_SECRET` are in GitHub:

1. Merge your changes to `main` → the CI/CD workflow triggers QA and Production deployments
2. The deployment workflow passes `CLEANUP_SECRET` to Bicep **only for QA and Production** (push to `main`) — PR infrastructure deployments do **not** receive this setting
3. Bicep configures it as an app setting in the Static Web App for QA and Production environments
4. The cleanup endpoint uses this setting to validate the `x-cleanup-secret` header from the scheduled workflow

> **Note:** PR preview environments will not have `CLEANUP_SECRET` configured and cannot run the cleanup endpoint. This is intentional — the scheduled cleanup workflow only targets QA and Production.

### 4. Set Up Environments (Optional but Recommended)

Go to **Settings** → **Environments** and create:

**Environment: `qa`**
- Set **Deployment branches** to `main` only

**Environment: `production`**
- Set **Deployment branches** to `main` only
- **Required reviewers:** Add team members for approval gate

### 5. Configure Protected Branches

In **Settings** → **Branches**:

1. Click **Add rule** for `main` branch
2. Enable:
   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
   - ✅ **Require code review from dismissal of stale pull request reviews**

**Recommended status checks:**
- `build` (Build & Test)
- `e2e` (E2E Tests)

**Done!** Your CI/CD pipeline is ready. 🎉

## Prerequisites

### Azure Setup

- ✅ Azure subscription with billing enabled
- ✅ Minimum roles: **Contributor** on subscription or resource group
- ✅ Azure CLI installed (`az --version`)

### GitHub Setup

- ✅ GitHub repository (you're reading this, so you have it!)
- ✅ Admin access to repository settings (to add secrets)
- ✅ Collaborators with access for review (optional)

---

## Service Principal Setup

### What is a Service Principal?

A service principal is an identity for your CI/CD pipeline to authenticate with Azure **without passwords**. GitHub Actions uses:

- **OIDC (OpenID Connect)**: Secure, no secrets needed
- **Alternative**: Personal access token (less secure, avoid if possible)

### Create Service Principal (Detailed)

#### Option 1: Azure CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Login to Azure
az login

# 2. List subscriptions
az account list --output table

# 3. Set subscription (if multiple)
az account set --subscription "subscription-id"

# 4. Create service principal
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --name "ZavaGiftExchange-github-cicd" \
  --role contributor \
  --scopes /subscriptions/$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "appId": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
  "displayName": "ZavaGiftExchange-github-cicd",
  "password": "xxxxx~xxxxx_xxx",
  "tenant": "87654321-4321-4321-4321-210987654321",
  "subscriptionId": "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"
}
```

**Save this entire JSON!** You'll paste it as the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in GitHub.

#### Option 2: Azure Portal

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** → **App registrations**
2. Click **New registration**
3. Name: `ZavaGiftExchange-github-cicd`
4. Click **Register**
5. Copy **Application (client) ID**
6. Go to **Certificates & secrets**
7. Click **New client secret**
8. Copy the value (not the ID)
9. Go to **Subscription** → **IAM** → **Add role assignment**
10. Assign **Contributor** role to the app

### Service Principal Permissions

Current setup uses **Contributor** role which allows:
- ✅ Create/update/delete resource groups
- ✅ Deploy Bicep templates
- ✅ Create all Azure resources
- ⚠️ Very permissive (suitable for trusted CI/CD)

**For tighter security** (advanced):

Create custom role with specific permissions:

```bash
az role assignment create \
  --assignee {appId} \
  --role "Custom CI/CD Role" \
  --scope /subscriptions/{subscription-id}
```

---

## GitHub Configuration

### Add Secret

**Location:** Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

**Add this single secret:**

| Name | Value | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` | Complete JSON output from service principal | From `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command (all 5 fields) |

**Example value:**
```json
{
  "appId": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
  "displayName": "ZavaGiftExchange-github-cicd",
  "password": "xxxxx~xxxxx_xxx",
  "tenant": "87654321-4321-4321-4321-210987654321",
  "subscriptionId": "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"
}
```

**That's the only secret needed!** Much simpler than before.

### Configure Environments

**Location:** Settings → Environments

#### Create `qa` Environment

1. Click **New environment**
2. Name: `qa`
3. **Deployment branches** → Select **main**
4. Optional: Add reviewers
5. Click **Configure environment**

#### Create `production` Environment

1. Click **New environment**
2. Name: `production`
3. **Deployment branches** → Select **main**
4. **Required reviewers** → Add team members
5. **Custom deployment branch policies** → Optional
6. Click **Configure environment**

**Result:** Production deployments require manual approval before proceeding.

### Protect Main Branch

**Location:** Settings → Branches

1. Click **Add branch protection rule**
2. Pattern: `main`
3. Enable:
   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ✅ **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**
   - ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
   - ✅ **Include administrators** (optional but recommended)

4. **Select required status checks:**
   - `build` (Build & Test job)
   - `e2e` (E2E Tests job)

**Result:** Code can't be merged to `main` without passing tests.

## Resource Naming Strategy

### Why Unique Names Matter

Since this is an **open-source project**, many developers will deploy their own instances to their Azure subscriptions. All Azure resource names must be **globally unique**, especially:

- **Cosmos DB accounts** (globally unique across all Azure regions)
- **Static Web Apps** (unique within Azure)
- **Azure Communication Services** (unique within Azure)

### How We Ensure Uniqueness

The Bicep template uses a **sophisticated naming strategy** that automatically generates unique names:

```bicep
# Each resource name combines:
var uniqueSuffix = uniqueString(
  resourceGroup().id,      # Your resource group
  deploymentId,            # PR number, environment, or run ID
  subscription().subscriptionId # Your subscription
)

# Results in names like:
# ss7hx5k9qm2p    (Cosmos DB - 24 char limit)
# ZavaGiftExchange-qa-7hx5k9qm2p  (Static Web App)
# ss-acs-7hx5k9qm2p         (Communication Services)
```

### Environment-Specific Deployment IDs

**PR Environments:**
```
deploymentId = "pr-{PR_NUMBER}"
# Example: pr-42
# Each PR gets its own dedicated Static Web App
```

**QA & Production:**
```
deploymentId = "qa-stable" or "prod-stable"
# Stable ID ensures consistent resource names across deployments
# Each environment has its own dedicated Static Web App
```

### Developer Experience

As a developer, you don't need to do anything special:

1. Fork the repo to your account
2. Run the workflow
3. ✅ Your resources automatically get unique names
4. No naming conflicts even if 100 developers deploy simultaneously

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Alice deploys PR #42**
```
Resource Group: ZavaGiftExchange-pr-42
Cosmos DB: ssa1b2c3d4e5f6g7h
Static Web App: ZavaGiftExchange-pr-42-a1b2c3d4e5f
```

**Scenario 2: Bob forks the repo and deploys prod to his subscription**
```
Resource Group: ZavaGiftExchange
Cosmos DB: ssx9y8z7w6v5u4t
Static Web App: ZavaGiftExchange-prod-x9y8z7w6v5
(Different uniqueSuffix = no conflicts!)
```

**Scenario 3: Carol deploys QA from her fork**
```
Resource Group: ZavaGiftExchange-qa
Cosmos DB: ssk1l2m3n4o5p6q
Static Web App: ZavaGiftExchange-qa-k1l2m3n4o5p
(Different uniqueSuffix = no conflicts!)
```

### What This Means for You

✅ **No more naming conflicts** - Cosmos DB, Static Web Apps, etc.  
✅ **Multiple developers can deploy simultaneously** - Each gets unique resources  
✅ **Safe for public open-source** - 100+ forks won't interfere with each other  
✅ **Automatic naming** - No manual configuration needed

## Workflow Overview

### Triggers

The CI/CD workflow runs automatically in these cases:

**1. Pull Request (Any activity)**
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
    branches: [main]
```

**Runs:** Build → Test → Deploy PR infrastructure → Preview → Comment

**2. Push to Main**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

**Runs:** Build → Test → Deploy QA → QA Tests → Deploy Production

**3. Manual Trigger (Future)**
You can add workflow_dispatch to allow manual triggers:
```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Deployment environment'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'
```

### Job Timeline

## Best Practices

### 1. Branch Strategy

**Recommended: GitHub Flow**

```
main (production)
 ↑
 └─← pull requests (feature branches)
     └─ pr/add-translations
     └─ pr/fix-cosmos-bug
     └─ pr/update-ui
```

**Process:**
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes, push commits
3. CI/CD runs build → tests → preview
4. Review PR comments and preview
5. Get code review (2+ reviewers recommended)
6. Merge when ready
7. CI/CD auto-deploys to QA
8. Test in QA environment
9. Manual approval triggers production deploy

### 2. Commit Messages

Use clear, semantic commit messages:

```
✅ Good:
- "feat: add French translations"
- "fix: cosmos db connection timeout"
- "docs: update local development guide"
- "test: add E2E test for language toggle"

❌ Bad:
- "Update stuff"
- "Fix bugs"
- "asdasd"
- "temp"
```

### 3. Pull Request Titles

Clear titles help with understanding changes:

```
✅ Good:
- "Add support for 9 languages including German and Dutch"
- "Fix email notification service initialization"
- "Refactor authentication logic for better security"

❌ Bad:
- "WIP"
- "Changes"
- "Stuff"
```

### 4. Environment Parity

Keep environments similar:

- **Dev** (local): Most permissive, email disabled
- **QA**: Production-like, all features enabled
- **Production**: Locked down, monitoring enabled

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting

**In Azure Portal:**

1. Go to Application Insights
2. Set up alerts for:
   - Failed requests > 5% of total
   - Server response time > 5s
   - Availability tests failing
3. Configure email/SMS notifications

### 6. Security

- ✅ Use service principals (not personal access tokens)
- ✅ Use OIDC (not passwords)
- ✅ Rotate credentials every 90 days
- ✅ Use branch protection rules
- ✅ Require code reviews
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Enable Advanced Security if available

### 7. Cost Management

**Monitor spending:**
1. Go to **Cost Management + Billing** in Azure Portal
2. Set budgets and alerts
3. Review monthly costs
4. Clean up unused PR environments

**Cost saving tips:**
- Delete old PR environments manually if needed
- Use Serverless Cosmos DB (pay per request)
- Monitor Application Insights costs

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails at "Build & Test"

**Problem:** `npm: command not found`

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Verify Node version in workflow:
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'  # Must match package.json "engines"
```

**Problem:** `tsc: command not found`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure TypeScript is in devDependencies
npm list typescript

# If missing:
npm install -D typescript
```

### Workflow Fails at "Azure Login"

**Problem:** `invalid json provided to creds parameter`

**Solution:**
1. Verify `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret contains valid JSON
2. Check the secret includes all 5 fields:
   - `appId`
   - `displayName`
   - `password`
   - `tenant`
   - `subscriptionId`
3. Copy-paste the entire JSON output from `az ad sp create-for-rbac` without modification

**Problem:** `The operation was not successful. Status code: 401. Error message: Authorization failed`

**Solution:**
1. Service principal may have expired (90+ days)
2. Create new service principal:
   ```bash
   az ad sp create-for-rbac \
     --name "ZavaGiftExchange-github-cicd-new" \
     --role contributor \
     --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}
   ```
3. Update `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret with new JSON
4. Delete old service principal when tested

### Workflow Fails at "Deploy Infrastructure"

**Problem:** `ERROR: The Bicep file could not be parsed`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Validate Bicep locally
az bicep build --file ./infra/main.bicep

# Check syntax
az deployment group validate \
  --resource-group ZavaGiftExchange \
  --template-file ./infra/main.bicep \
  --parameters ./infra/parameters.prod.json
```

**Problem:** `Insufficient permissions for operation`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify service principal has Contributor role
az role assignment list \
  --assignee {appId} \
  --output table

# Grant role if missing
az role assignment create \
  --assignee {appId} \
  --role "Contributor" \
  --scope /subscriptions/{subscription-id}
```

### Workflow Fails at "Deploy to QA"

**Problem:** `Cannot read deployment token`

**Solution:**
1. Verify Static Web App exists in `ZavaGiftExchange-qa` resource group
2. Check Azure CLI is authenticated with correct subscription
3. Verify step "Get Static Web App Token" succeeded

**Problem:** `401 Unauthorized`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify Static Web App token
az staticwebapp secrets list \
  --name ZavaGiftExchange-qa \
  --resource-group ZavaGiftExchange-qa

# Token should be returned successfully
```

### E2E Tests Fail in QA

**Problem:** `Timeout waiting for element`

**Solution:**
1. Check QA app is fully deployed and responsive
2. Increase Playwright timeout in `playwright.config.ts`
3. Verify workflow step "Get Static Web App Token" succeeded (base URL derives from infrastructure output)

### Production Deployment Waiting Forever

**Problem:** Deployment stuck in "Awaiting Approval"

**Solution:**
1. Go to Actions → specific workflow run
2. See "Waiting" section with "Review deployments"
3. Click "Review deployments"
4. Approve for "production"
5. Workflow continues

---

## Security

### Secrets Management

**What's stored as secrets:**
- `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` ✅ JSON containing all needed authentication info
  - `appId` (public ID)
  - `tenant` (public ID)
  - `subscriptionId` (public ID)
  - `password` (secret, only stored once, uses OIDC for authentication)

**What's NOT stored:**
- Individual client ID / tenant ID / subscription ID variables
- Connection strings ❌ Auto-generated in Azure
- API keys ❌ Auto-generated in Static Web App
- Deployment tokens ❌ Retrieved dynamically from Azure CLI during workflow

**Simpler approach:**
- Only 1 secret to manage (vs 3 before)
- All auth info in one place
- Easier to rotate (regenerate 1 secret)

### Credential Rotation

Every 90 days:

```bash
# Create new service principal
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --name "ZavaGiftExchange-github-cicd-new" \
  --role contributor \
  --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}

# Copy entire JSON output
# Update AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret in GitHub
# Delete old service principal after testing
az ad sp delete --id {old-appId}
```

### Audit Trail

GitHub tracks all deployments:
1. Go to repo → **Deployments**
2. View who deployed what, when
3. See all environment activity

Azure tracks deployments in Activity Log:
1. Go to **Resource Group** → **Activity log**
2. Filter by Deployments
3. See all infrastructure changes

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to manually create resource groups?**
A: No, the workflow creates all resource groups automatically (PR, QA, and Production). Just add the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret and push to trigger deployments.

**Q: Can I deploy to production without approval?**
A: Remove the `production` environment from settings, but NOT recommended for production code.

**Q: How do I rollback a deployment?**
A: Redeploy previous commit. GitHub Actions maintains full deployment history.

**Q: What if Azure resources are deleted accidentally?**
A: Re-deploy using the workflow. Bicep templates are idempotent (safe to run multiple times).

**Q: How do I add more team members?**
A: Go to repo → Settings → Collaborators → Add person. They'll need approval if branch protection enabled.

**Q: Can I use a different Azure subscription?**
A: Yes, recreate the service principal for the new subscription and update the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.

**Q: What if deployment tokens expire?**
A: Azure automatically regenerates them. Workflow handles this.
